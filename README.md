# VBA Challenge
## Overview of Project
The analysis was intended to give a user a clear picture of how 12 stocks performed over 2017 and 2018 taking into consideration beginning and ending values as well as the volume that each stock was traded in each year.

## Results
Based on the results its clear that in 2017 all stocks except for "TERP" gave a positive rate of return while in 2018 all stocks except for "ENPH" and "RUN" gave a negative rate of return. "DQ" which was of high interest by Steve and his parents had a return of 199.45% in 2017 and a negative return of 62.6% in 2018, suggesting that the stock is relatively volatile and more intrinsic data would be needed to confidently recommend whether this would be a good investment. It is also worth mentioning that after refactoring code to efficiently store values and loop through the data, our program was able to reduce the run time of the program by a third of the time.
